# AnimalShelter

@author Amelia Tran and Megi Hoxha

The data is from Kaggle. According to the description from Shelter Animal Outcomes on Kaggle, “every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters as a result of owners giving them up or they are picked up out of cruelty situations such as abandoned by their owners or from getting lost. Many of these animals get adopted by other families however, about 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.” With this dataset we are going to use random forest and support vector machine models to investigate on what affects the animal outcomes and what we can do to improve their shelter outcome and help them get adopted.
